This is an implementation of a contest winning interactive report card design by Polly Avignon (http://www.pollyd.com/).

See and read about it here: http://www.good.is/post/winner-redesign-the-report-card-project/

TODO:
 - Missing sections.
 - Find better openly available fonts.
 - Find a better shadow implementation for triangles (ribbon and grade log tooltip)
 - Let HTML5 working group know they need a way to turn off the meter/progress wrapping. No css override to eliminate it!
 - Redo all the images used so far as svgs. Should take all of 5 minutes (and then I can color them correctly with CSS!).
 - Redo css so either everything scales horizontally or dependencies are noted. I think milestones and grade log are the 
  only scalable sections at the moment.
